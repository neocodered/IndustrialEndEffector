### Register Level Code
## Components
# Main File
-Performs calculations for the distance, pitch, and yaw of objects.
-Coordinates the overall functionality of the system.
#ToF Library
-Interfaces with the VL53L0x Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor.
-Reads distance values from the ToF sensor.
#UART Library
-Handles serial communication using the UART protocol.
