# IndustrialEndEffector
 This project features an industrial end effector for automated pick and place robots with a vacuum gripper. It uses four ToF sensors to accurately measure box yaw and pitch angles. Data is transmitted via Modbus protocol over USB, ensuring seamless integration with robot control panels for precise orientation detection and efficient communication.
